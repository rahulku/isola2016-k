\section{Conclusion}We have in this document outlined some views on the potential in 
combining modeling and programming, supported by analysis 
capabilities such as static analysis, model checking, theorem 
proving, monitoring, and testing. We believe that the time is right 
for the formal methods/modeling and programming language 
communities to join forces. To some extent this is already 
happening in the small. However, we believe that we are standing in 
front of a major wave of research creating a united foundation for 
modeling, programming and verification. A cynical argument is that 
this is all obvious, which may be true.
